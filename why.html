		                <p>I grew up eating lots of fresh fruit and I love eating fruit. However, there are so many different kinds and it’s hard for me to remember which are in season. Sometimes when I go to the grocery store, if I’m feeling worn out, I won’t have the energy to look at all the fruit and find which is freshest. This website seeks to provide a good baseline of potential fresh fruit, which will save me mental energy (and hopefully help me eat more fruit).</p>
		                <p>Americans in general don’t eat enough fruit. In 2009, the CDC found that <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/wk/mm5935.pdf" target="_none">less than 35% of Americans were consuming enough fruit every day</a> (about one and a half to two cups).  I find it improbable that 65% of Americans simply don’t like fresh fruit. Growing up going to public school, the fruit at lunch was always very low quality – and I went to many public schools all over the world. I find it much more likely that fruit is unapproachable – that is, people feel overwhelmed by the task of learning how to pick out good fruit and they’ve also had too many experiences with bad fruit.</p>
